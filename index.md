I am an assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics at Brown University (Email: jon_steingrimsson@brown.edu).

Prior to joining Brown, I received my PhD from the Department of Statistical Science at Cornell University advised by Professor Rob Strawderman. From 2015-2017 I was a Postdoctoral Fellow with Professor Michael Rosenblum at Johns Hopkins University.
