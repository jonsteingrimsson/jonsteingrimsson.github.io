I am an assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics at Brown University. My research focuses on:

  -  Risk prediction models for time to event outcomes, mostly centered on accounting for censoring in several machine learning algorithms.  

  -  Adaptive enrichment designs that try to learn which sub-populations benefit from treatment.  

  -  Covariate adjustment for clinical trials.  

Prior to joining Brown, I received my PhD from the Department of Statistical Science at Cornell University advised by Professor Rob Strawderman. From 2015-2017 I was a Postdoctoral Fellow with Professor Michael Rosenblum at Johns Hopkins University.
